### Experiments and Development

- `DQN_Agent.py`:

  - [Originally written within this repository. (DQN Maze)](https://github.com/13biti/DQN_Maze)
  - Check commit messages for a timeline of development, experiments, and agent evolution in that repository .

  - Later refactored into a standalone submodule named `DQN_Agent`.

### Call for Collaboration

- i am actively seeking contributions from other programmers to improve the DQN agent . Specific areas where we need help include:

  1. Reward Policies: Designing more effective reward structures to improve the agent's learning efficiency and performance.

  2. Epsilon Decay Strategy: Optimizing the epsilon-greedy exploration strategy to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively.

  3. Chain Inheritance in DQN: Implementing or improving chain inheritance mechanisms to make the DQN architecture more modular and extensible.

New Ideas: We are open to innovative approaches, such as novel network architectures, advanced exploration techniques, or integration with other reinforcement learning methods.

If you're interested in contributing, please feel free to:

- Fork the repository and submit pull requests with your improvements.
- Share your ideas or suggestions via issues or discussions in the DQN Maze repository.
- Collaborate on refactoring, testing, or adding new features to the DQN_Agent module.

Let's work together to build a more powerful and versatile DQN agent! Join us in this exciting journey of reinforcement learning exploration.
